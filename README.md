# Halo Semua! ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Muhammad Ramdhan.
I'm an Android Developer with over 2 years of professional experience. Currently, I work as an Senior Associate Android Developer at EDTS, where I focus on creating robust, user-centric mobile applications.

Previously, I contributed as a Technology Management Trainee, gaining valuable experience on projects such as Poinku (Indomaret), LPI (Sugarcane Agricultural Administration System), and eMart (mini self-service mart).

I graduated from Universitas Ahmad Dahlan in 2022, and during my studies, I honed my skills in Mobile Development through the prestigious Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka. This program further solidified my passion for creating impactful mobile solutions.

I'm passionate about utilizing modern libraries and best practices to craft efficient Android applications that improve user experiences.
