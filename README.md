# Halo Semua! ðŸ‘‹
Allow me to introduce myself, my name is **Muhammad Ramdhan**.\
A Physics Education undergraduate student at Ahmad
Dahlan University (UAD), class of 2018. I've created basic Android applications
from college assignments that are now available on the Google Play Store under
the name "All in One Nuclear Physics App (AONPA)." This encounter piqued my
curiosity in learning more about Android application development.
